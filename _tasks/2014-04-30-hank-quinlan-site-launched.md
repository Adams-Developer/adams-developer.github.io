I hosted a party last month and asked my friends to bring cookies.
Next month I'll be hosting another party.
Last month, the friends I invited brought guests with them. Some guests brought
cookies and ate more than others. Some guests brought cookies and didnt eat more 
than others. I only want to invite friends, and friends of friends who didnt 
eat more cookies than they brought.
